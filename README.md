## Simple Counter Example

This repo is a simple example application with React Native and Redux.

This repo is modified from [example-react-native-redux](https://github.com/alinz/example-react-native-redux). I think my version may be simplier to understand.


### Usage
- clone the project and go to `Counter` folder
- run `npm install`

Cheers,
